Management seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that drive employee productivity across the organization. The Human Resources and Development department has provided a comprehensive employee dataset containing demographic, performance, and engagement-related variables. The primary business objective is to DEVELOP A PREDICTIVE MODEL that accurately estimates an employee’s ProductivityScore based on key predictors such as age, department, tenure, education level, remote work ratio, job satisfaction, work hours, project load, managerial feedback, training participation, promotion history, and recent performance ratings.

By identifying and quantifying the most influential drivers of productivity, the organization aims to:
- Improve workforce management and development strategies,
- Optimize training and performance review programs,
- Support data-driven decision-making in promotions, hiring, and resource allocation, and
- Enhance overall organizational efficiency and employee satisfaction.

The success of this initiative will be measured by the model’s ability to accurately predict productivity and provide actionable insights that inform HR and management policies.
